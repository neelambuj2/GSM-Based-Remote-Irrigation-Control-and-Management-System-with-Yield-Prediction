# GSM-Based-Remote-Irrigation-Control-and-Management-System-with-Yield-Prediction
.This Paper is about how irrigation in agriculture can be remotely managed and monitored using Android application backed by GSM services .User can remotely control the irrigation equipment .User can also use automatic irrigation mode where user can select a moisture level and system will take care that required level of moisture is achieved and then pump is turned off. It has yield prediction algorithm and live monitoring feature of conditions in field with SMS request .The machine learning algorithm hosted on Amazon cloud will use those parameters to predict the yield .The parameters will be sent to Amazon cloud using HTTP
